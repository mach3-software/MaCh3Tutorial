# Welcome to MaCh3 Tutorial
After this tutorial you should know how to run MCMC, implement systematic uncertainties and how to plot standard Bayesian diagnostic.

## How to Start?
To compile simply
```
mkdir build;
cd build;
cmake ../
make -jN [set number of threads]
make install
```
then
```
source bin/setup.MaCh3.sh
source bin/setup.MaCh3Tutorial.sh
```
alternatively you can use containers by
```
docker pull ghcr.io/mach3-software/mach3tutorial:alma9latest
```
To reed more how to use containers check our wiki [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/wiki/12.-Containers)

## Hot to run LLH scan
To run an LLH scan simply do
```
./bin/MCMCTutorial Inputs/ManagerTest.yaml
```
These are very useful for validations and to compare with other fitters

## How to run MCMC
To run MCMC simply
```
./bin/MCMCTutorial Inputs/ManagerTest.yaml
```
Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You have just completed finished you first MCMC chain.

## How to Plot?
You can produce simple plots with
```
./bin/ProcessMCMC bin/TutorialDiagConfig.yaml Test.root
```

## How to Setup your analysis
In the next step you gonna modify analysis setup and repeat steps.
First let's better understand `Inputs/SystematicsTest.yaml`. This config controls what systematic uncertainties will be used in the analysis for example like this:
```
- Systematic:
    Names:
      FancyName: Norm_Param_0
    Error: 0.11
    FlatPrior: false
    IsFixed: false
    Mode: [ 0 ]
    ParameterBounds: [0, 999.]
    ParameterGroup: Xsec
    TargetNuclei: [12, 16]
    KinematicCuts:
      - TrueQ2: [0.25, 0.5]
    ParameterValues:
      Generated: 1.
      PreFitValue: 1.
    DetID: 985
    StepScale:
      MCMC: 0.2
    Type: Norm
```

As first step let's modify `Error: 0.11` to `Error: 2.0`, this should significantly modify error which shou.d be noticeable in MCMC.

Lastly we need to modify name of output file. This is governed by manager class (read more [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/wiki/01.-Manager-and-config-handling)) modify `OutputFile: "Test.root"` in `Inputs/ManagerTest.yaml` to for example
`OutputFile: "Test_Modified.root"`.

Now let's run MCMC again
```
./bin/MCMCTutorial Inputs/ManagerTest.yaml
```
Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
Next step is to compare both chains.

Warning: If you modified files in main folder not build you will have to call make install!
## How to Plot Comparisons?
Now that you have two chains you can try comparing them using following.
```
./bin/ProcessMCMC bin/TutorialDiagConfig.yaml Test.root Default_Chain Test_Modified.root Modified_Chain
```
This will produce pdf file with overlayed posteriors. Most should be similarly except modified parameter.


## MCMC Diagnostic
Crucial part of MCMC is diagnostic whether chain converged or not. You can read more on [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/wiki/11.-Step-size-tuning)

```
./bin/DiagMCMC Test.root bin/TutorialDiagConfig.yaml
```

## More advanced development????
